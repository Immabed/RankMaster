# RankMaster

RankMaster is an android app that allows anyone to make standings for a game or sport in seconds.

The goal of RankMaster is to allow extreme customizability and flexibility when creating a ranking system for standings, allowing any number of people to play in a match, any number of matches to be played, each match with a set of custom statistics that are stored, and a ranking system based on the statistics that is designed to the user's preferences.

RankMaster is a final project for my CMPT 166 university course, as a software project written in java that makes use of object oriented programming techniques, especially inheritance and polymorphism.

RankMaster is a work in progress, and may never reach a feature complete state.
